# ResourceBlockerAndroid

Quick and dirty android project to block resources to test how other app reacts to resources being hogged. Simply pull 
and build. You might have to either 1) run the `gradle sync` again or 2) fix the paths in the CMakeLists.txt to fix your own 
path. Lastly, you will need `ndk` tools to build it locally.
